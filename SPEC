        Slimdown, a specification

The title is optional, but needs at least 4+4 (8) spaces. This enables longer
titles, subtitles, and centered titles.

This is a sentence preceding a command, which is

    echo hi

This is a sentence preceding a list of things (colon optional)

  one

  two

  three

Fundamentally, a list of items has spaces between for _decorated lists,_ like

  item 1
  And some more details, because it's nice to have.

  item 2
  Some more notes on this second entry.

  item 3
  Changes regarding something
  And another line besides (80-char width, ideally).

Sections are denoted by having a colon.

This would (automatically) be considered a section heading:

(Because it has a colon.)

It's also considered a section because there's no (\n  ) after it.

So, parsing slimdown based on the above

  See if it's a command first (optional sentence\n\n + 4 spaces)

  Then see if it's a list (2-space entries separated by newlines).

  Section text has a colon

  Section text does _not_ have a "dot word boundary" of "... a. Aaaa"
                                                             ^^^^

I guess sections have to go into a collection so that we can decorate duplicate
strings as references...

Section Test 1:

  Oh and we have a list

  So will it be parsed as a section or get confused?

Section Test 2:

    A command without a preceding sentence!

It only generates one cube. Let's try another example:

    The above should not be a section, because there is a "dot word boundary" of
    of "... cube. Let's ..."

Section Test 3: was a sentence like "Assumption: ..."

Well, did you want it rendered as a section or a sentence? It's ambiguous, and
in some cases we want it as a section and other times as a sentence. Let's warn
about it in our linter (yes, I guess we need one now!).
